# paintingapp
playing around in WPF and thought of making a painting app, gonn see if i can make it WiiMote compatible so u can paint with a remote and maybe with a nunchuck
will upload some stuff soon (hopefully) 

!!! MUST DOWNLOAD .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime (v8.0.10) TO RUN !!!

more boring details below: 

Made in C# and used some resources to help with this because I dont want to learn Java even tho both came from C and have similar syntax. 
Currently in active development. 

So far added the following: 
- Draw function
- Clear canvas function
- Import image function (bit buggy so not that perfect)
- Change to pre-selected colour palette

WIP: 
- Dynamic colour palette (choose from any colours u want)
- Save the image
- Draw shape functions
- Change properties of brush (apart from colours)
- Move and scale imported images

dunno what else to add ngl
